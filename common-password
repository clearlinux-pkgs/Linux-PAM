# /etc/pam.d/common-password - password-related modules common to all services
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of modules that define the services to be
# used to change user passwords.  The default is pam_unix.

# Explanation of pam_unix options:
#
# The "sha512" option enables salted SHA512 passwords.  Without this option,
# the default is Unix crypt.  Prior releases used the option "md5".
#
# The "use_authtok" option tells pam_unix to omit any password checks that
# cracklib already does and accepts the input from cracklib.
#
# See the pam_unix manpage for other options.

# Explanation of pam_cracklib options:
#
# pam_cracklib by default includes various password checks against the
# dictionary but also against weird password changes, like palindromes.
#
# "retry=3" allows 3 passes at changing the password, after which the
# PAM conversation needs to be restarted from the start.
#
# "difok=3" allows password changes when at least 3 characters are different
# from the previous password.
#
password	required			pam_cracklib.so retry=3 difok=3
# here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)
password	[success=1 default=ignore]	pam_unix.so sha512 use_authtok
# here's the fallback if no module succeeds
password	requisite			pam_deny.so
# prime the stack with a positive return value if there isn't one already;
# this avoids us returning an error just because nothing sets a success code
# since the modules above will each just jump around
password	required			pam_permit.so
# and here are more per-package modules (the "Additional" block)
