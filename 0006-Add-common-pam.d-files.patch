+#
+# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
+# and should contain a list of modules that define the services to be
+# used to change user passwords.  The default is pam_unix.
+
+# Explanation of pam_unix options:
+#
+# The "sha512" option enables salted SHA512 passwords.  Without this option,
+# the default is Unix crypt.  Prior releases used the option "md5".
+#
+# The "use_authtok" option tells pam_unix to omit any password checks that
+# cracklib already does and accepts the input from cracklib.
+#
+# See the pam_unix manpage for other options.
+
+# Explanation of pam_cracklib options:
+#
+# pam_cracklib by default includes various password checks against the
+# dictionary but also against weird password changes, like palindromes.
+#
+# "retry=3" allows 3 passes at changing the password, after which the
+# PAM conversation needs to be restarted from the start.
+#
+# "difok=3" allows password changes when at least 3 characters are different
+# from the previous password.
